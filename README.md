# qook
Pure language standard, "safe" Rust bindings for the pure C++11/OpenCL Qrack quantum computer simulator library

(**Qook** is just pure Qrack.)

To use this package, it's helpful to be familiar with [unitaryfund/qrack](https://github.com/unitaryfund/qrack). Users gain **much** more control over options by building **unitaryfund/qrack** from source.

A future release might include packaged Qrack binaries; for now, you must build and install Qrack from source in order to use this library crate. (See the Qrack README for instructions.) `cargo` will dynamically link [`qook`](https://github.com/unitaryfund/qook) against your system installation of Qrack.

Import and instantiate [`QrackSimulator`](https://github.com/unitaryfund/qook/blob/main/src/qrack_simulator.rs) instances. This simulator can perform arbitrary single qubit and controlled-single-qubit gates, as well as other specific gates like `SWAP`.

Any 2x2 bit operator matrix is represented by an array of 8 (real) floating point numbers, grouped in immediate pairs of real then imaginary components of complex numbers, then in [**row-major order**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order).

Primitive and vector "`b`" parameters represent [**Pauli operator bases**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices). They are specified according to the enumeration of the [`Pauli`](https://github.com/unitaryfund/qook/blob/main/src/pauli.rs) class.

`MC[x]` and `MAC[x]` methods are controlled single bit gates, with as many control qubits as you specify via the Rust vector `c` argument. `MCX` is multiply-controlled Pauli X, and `MACX` is "anti-"controlled Pauli X, i.e. "anti-control" activates the gate if all control bits are specifically **off**, as opposed to **on**.

The Qrack installation binary directory contains a `qrack_cl_precompile` executable for your platform, to compile OpenCL kernels once, beforehand, avoiding the need to recompile "just-in-time" every time that you load this library in a binary executable. If you no longer want to use precompiled kernels, or if precompilation fails, just delete the `~/.qrack` directory, or the equivalent `.qrack` sub-directory in the user home folder of your operating system.

The API is meant to exactly mirror (Python-based) PyQrack. See [https://pyqrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://pyqrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for an API reference.
